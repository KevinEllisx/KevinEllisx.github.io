<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
