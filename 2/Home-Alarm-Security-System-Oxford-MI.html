<p>In the past, a surveillance security system normally consisted of numerous cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and showed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or several, they work with your home's internet network to send out video footage right to your computer or mobile device. Most consumer cameras save information internally, on a detachable microSD card, or remotely on the cloud.</p>

This action coupled with an electrical existing (generally at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to spot a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are extremely common and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control board, or they can generally be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
