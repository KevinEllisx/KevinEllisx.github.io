<h3>Wireless Video Security System Moscow ID 83843</h3>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Webcam combines two essential gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera detects movement, it switches on its two effective LED beams in addition to its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

The switch from daylight to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked great switching from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes prior to it even discovered I existed. </p>
