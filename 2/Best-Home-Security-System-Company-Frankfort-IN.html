During testing, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was discovered. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
