<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
