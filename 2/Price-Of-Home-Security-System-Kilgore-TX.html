<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place often enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the customer service experience differs widely depending on the dealership you go with. </p>
