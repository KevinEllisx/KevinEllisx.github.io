<h3>Best Wireless Home Security System  in California</h3>
<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based upon two unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter releases continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the change in field strength compromises due to the presence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is created. The system is covert after installation. Care must be required to ensure the surrounding soil offers good drainage in order to avoid problem alarms.</p>
<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
