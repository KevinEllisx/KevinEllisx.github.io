We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion.
