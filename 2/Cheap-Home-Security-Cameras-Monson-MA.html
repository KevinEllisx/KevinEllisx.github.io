<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which might be a budget-friendly choice for consumers in backwoods. We suggest cellular systems because they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.
