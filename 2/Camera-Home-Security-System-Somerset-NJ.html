Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
