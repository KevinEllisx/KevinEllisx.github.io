<p>Unlike wired security systems that run through your phone lines and can need more substantial installation, wireless systems can be installed in a matter of minutes as a fast and pain-free  DIY task.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
