<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All items release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by a things is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of discovering tiny distinctions in temperature.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
