<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a wide range of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable cost, the one area where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
