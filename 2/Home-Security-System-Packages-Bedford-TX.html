<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
