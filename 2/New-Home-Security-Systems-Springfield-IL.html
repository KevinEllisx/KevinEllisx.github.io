The Ring Stick Up Web cam is available in wired and battery versions, which can be used inside your home and outdoors. But neither can tape continuously, and they both need the Ring Secure strategy to record recordings.

The system can be set up to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Night vision: Most burglaries take place after dark, so this feature is nearly as crucial as motion detection.
