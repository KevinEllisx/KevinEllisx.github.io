<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of buying a self-monitored security system. Professionally monitored security systems need a month-to-month monitoring charge that can range from ($ 20 to $60) each month. When identifying how much an alarm system expenses customers require to recognize that if they include more features, the cost will increase.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).
