Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to compare an individual and a vehicle, for instance, allows you to cut down on unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
