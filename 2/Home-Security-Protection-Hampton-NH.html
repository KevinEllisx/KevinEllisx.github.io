<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
