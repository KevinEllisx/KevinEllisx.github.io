<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore items that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
