<p>Put simply, security doorbells are just small security cameras - wired or wireless - that include a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Combining the advantages of a security camera and an intercom gives you a wide range of effective functions to secure your home or business. The videos your camera records most likely will not be saved on the camera itself. Many home security cameras utilize cloud services to keep and provide remote access to video footage Some designs have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to review video, however this is an uncommon feature.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
