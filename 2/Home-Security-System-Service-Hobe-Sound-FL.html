<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and ownerships.

<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales consultant. He supplied the recommendations concerning what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek showed up and dealt with the installation right on time. He talked to us concerning positioning of some of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also assisted me in filling the app and completing the online set-up procedure. He also examined the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were extremely professional and helpful. Thanks.</p>

<p>However, in any scenario where standard-definition camera are utilized, the quality is going to be bad since the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these gadgets is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the outcomes are the exact same); they usually capture vertical and horizontal fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is usually 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate inside or inside - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is easy to install. That's just $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the peace of mind of expert monitoring.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester stated the professional offered solid customer care: He dropped a few unneeded window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some problems with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
