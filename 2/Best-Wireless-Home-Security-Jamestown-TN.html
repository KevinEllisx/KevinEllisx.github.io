As soon as a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
