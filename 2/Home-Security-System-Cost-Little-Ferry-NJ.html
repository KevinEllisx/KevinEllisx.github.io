<p>Nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are clearly not hindered by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can guarantee - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the restricted advantages that the system might provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>The majority of home security systems involve Do It Yourself installation of surveillance equipment, so I ensure that that's an easy process.
