<p>SimpliSafe, on the other hand, tends to cost in between $200 and $500 for initial equipment purchase. That's because it doesn't use the rent-to-own model that's popular with the majority of security brand names.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
