<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
