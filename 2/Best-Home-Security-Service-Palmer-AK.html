<h2>Wireless Camera Systems Overview Palmer</h2>
<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security guard. A number of cities likewise require a permit to even operate a home and own security system.

A picture of that worker exists on screen for verification (validating it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating occurs.</p>
