When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
