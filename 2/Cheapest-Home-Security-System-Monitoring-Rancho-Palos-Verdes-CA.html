<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send informs, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Not fantastic, not terrible, but with a really simple setup procedure (and trust me, that really is a killer feature when it concerns smart cameras.) This newer variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>
