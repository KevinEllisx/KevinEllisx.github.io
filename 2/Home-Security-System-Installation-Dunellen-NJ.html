If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen.
