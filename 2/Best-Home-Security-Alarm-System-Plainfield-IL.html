<p>After testing, we sent each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Web cam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
