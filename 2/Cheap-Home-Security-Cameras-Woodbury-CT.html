<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly innovative, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year agreement, but because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So select what will be the better offer for you. Go with the contract and reap those cost savings if you know you'll remain put for at least three years. However if you may upgrade to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best choice.</p>
<p>While the majority of companies give you the alternative to add both outdoor and indoor cameras to your security bundle, SimpliSafe's choice is limited to one indoor surveillance camera. The camera consists of functions like complimentary streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take pictures of activity and can't pan or move-- basic features found on a lot of surveillance cameras. </p>
