<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and general flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and effortless smooth.
