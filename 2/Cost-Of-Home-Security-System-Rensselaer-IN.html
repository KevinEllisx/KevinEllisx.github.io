We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
