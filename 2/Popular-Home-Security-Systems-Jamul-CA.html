<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
