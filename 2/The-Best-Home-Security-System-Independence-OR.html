The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<h3>Alarm System Security Independence OR 97351</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>Among the difficulties wise alarm position to the consumer is the risk of being hacked. Improper home network setups, flaws in the gadgets or password compromise could allow a hacker to break into the system and determine if anyone is home, or even seize control. Though keeping the vast amount of information can be a concern, it's not uncommon for IP CCTV systems to have software that governs how long the video is kept, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for example.</p>

The camera includes functions like totally free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, however it does not take snapshots of activity and can't move or pan-- basic features found on many surveillance cameras. </p>
