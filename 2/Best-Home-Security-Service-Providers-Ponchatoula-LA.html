Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's often skewed by factors such as hesitation over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that cause incorrect alarms. While improvements in recent years have actually made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own special wireless technology, which can't be interfered with by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>

<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

On the other hand, bullet-shaped cameras are more typical. They have a cylinder shape that plainly stands apart to alert burglars that your home is under surveillance.</p>
<p>A few of the more costly cameras are equipped with humidity and temperature sensing units and will connect with other connected home devices such as thermostats and clever lighting systems.
