<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system relies on a gadget called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It acts as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensors and 3rd party-devices through Z-Wave and controlling them utilizing the app or voice control. ADT uses monitored security packages that are personalized to safeguard your home.

Not fantastic, not awful, but with a truly easy setup process (and trust me, that really is a killer feature when it concerns wise cameras.) This newer variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>
