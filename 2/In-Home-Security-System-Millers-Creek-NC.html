<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick action times and overall adaptability. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was simple and easy and quite darn streamlined. Otherwise, this company offers a similar feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks.

Given all of the other benefits, it's simple to see why many people are choosing this choice. </p>
