We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

In some cases, the company is able to provide professional installation services the same day.</p>
