We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
