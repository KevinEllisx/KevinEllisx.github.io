<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
