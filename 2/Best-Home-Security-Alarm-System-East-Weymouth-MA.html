<p>The 2nd important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing built-in alarm, so it functions as a home alarm as well as a security camera.

It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've labeled (after a knowing duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
