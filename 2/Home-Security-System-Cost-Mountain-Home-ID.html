<p>Stopped working authorizations ought to lead to an alarm or at least a timed lockout to avoid experimenting with possible codes.  Some systems can be set up to allow deactivation of specific sensors or groups.  High-end systems permit multiple access codes, and may even permit them to be utilized only when, or on specific days, or only in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center need to arrange an oral code to be provided by a licensed individual in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that an additional alarm response is unnecessary. Similar to access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, state, for furnace repairperson to get in the cooking area and basement sensor locations but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are likewise systems that permit a duress code to be gone into and silence the local alarm, however still activate the remote alarm to summon the cops to a break-in.</p>
