These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Spending for the equipment in advance provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>

They provide flexibility in their equipment and readily available plans, enabling property owners to choose the security service that best suits their requirements.

A majority of the complaints center around false information concerning the compulsory three year agreement. In reality, most clients were not conscious they were making such a long term dedication. This, combined with the extreme charge for premature cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may give some pause in picking Protect America as their home security option.</p>
