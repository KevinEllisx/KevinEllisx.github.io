<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these issues modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer support experience varies widely depending on the dealer you go with. </p>
