<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>We also like that Ring still has decent smart home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with smart home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your clever outlets with your total security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
