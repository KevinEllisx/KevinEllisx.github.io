<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to as much as 20 member of the family. Nevertheless, shared monitoring isn't a function offered from all companies. Be sure to investigate the company's features or speak with a representative directly if this is a high top priority.
