When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
