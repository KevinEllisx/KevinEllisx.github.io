As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
