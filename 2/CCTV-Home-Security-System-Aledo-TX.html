<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you pay for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, cops departments across the country respond to countless incorrect alarms from resident and business security systems every year. This costs towns and cities millions of dollars in wasted police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is easy and dependable to use, but costly and eccentric unless you want the convenience of a professional install and upkeep.</p>

Improper home network setups, defects in the devices or password compromise might permit a hacker to get into the system and figure out if anyone is home, or even take control. Though saving the huge amount of data can be a concern, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software application that governs how long the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to save storage space, for example.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see numerous growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies widely depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
