<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
