If a homeowner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
