<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system detects a burglary, fire, or other emergency, it alerts the security team and, sometimes, emergency situation responders. Unfortunately, history has revealed that surveillance technologies put in place for one purpose inevitably expand into other usages. And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear limits for what CCTV systems should be able to do presents a significant danger.</p>
