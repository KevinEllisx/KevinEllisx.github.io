<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of 2 piece sensing unit that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either normally open or typically closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether the style is generally open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electrical current (normally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to find a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are extremely typical and are found either wired straight to an alarm control panel, or they can usually be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
