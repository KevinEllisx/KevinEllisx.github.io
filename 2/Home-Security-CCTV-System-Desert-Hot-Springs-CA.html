<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the precise same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
