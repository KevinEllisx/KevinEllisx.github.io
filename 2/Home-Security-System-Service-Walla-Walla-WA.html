<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
