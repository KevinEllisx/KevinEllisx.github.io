<p>Frontpoint uses 5 packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan but wound up dissatisfied with its lack of live video surveillance.

It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security strategy, the exact same company that monitors the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically likely, having an expert established the system might provide you more confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have it all-- see things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It seldom works.</p>
<p>The drawback? It's really easy to commit security mistakes that will leave your home susceptible. The moment you drive out of signal variety or turn your phone to plane mode is the minute you have actually left your house open. If you aren't mindful, this open hole in your security can prove to be a huge problem. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a problem. Nevertheless, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to contact the cops or other emergency situation services if your home remains in risk. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and therefore is still the better option for many who are just worried about cost. </p>
