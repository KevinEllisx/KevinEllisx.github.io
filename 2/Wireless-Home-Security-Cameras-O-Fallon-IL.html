<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
