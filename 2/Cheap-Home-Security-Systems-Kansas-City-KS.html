<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Activity notifications inform the user whenever considerable activity is discovered near the camera. Find out if you can get notifications by means of push alerts, text, and or e-mail. They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first location. What you're paying for is mostly that big name in blue. </p>
