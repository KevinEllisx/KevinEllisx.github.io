<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a knowing period).
