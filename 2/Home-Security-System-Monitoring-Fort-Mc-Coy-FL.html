<p>The huge reward is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that does not look like a home security system.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
