<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
