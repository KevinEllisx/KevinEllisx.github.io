<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.

I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes before it even observed I was there. </p>
