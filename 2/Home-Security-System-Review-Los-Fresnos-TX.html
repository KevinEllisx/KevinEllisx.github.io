<p>One of the first choices that you'll require to make is if you need a wireless or wired security camera system, and the appropriate response likely depends upon where you intend to place the cameras and parts.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
