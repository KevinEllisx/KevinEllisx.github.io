<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
