<p>You'll get current equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides as much as 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.

But if your main goal is keeping criminals out of your house and protecting your residential or commercial property, you do not require to spend a package.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see so many growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies extensively depending upon the dealer you choose. </p>
