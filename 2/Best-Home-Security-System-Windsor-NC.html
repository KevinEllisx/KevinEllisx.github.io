<p>The majority of the self-monitored starter kits don't include outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a little bit more difficult to install because they have to be mounted to a home. Outside security cameras are likewise more expensive considering that they are made to withstand the aspects. In an effort to keep starter sets easy to install and budget friendly, they're often left out of the basic packages.</p>
<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a bit of an issue is between taping and discovering motion.

<p>The second crucial thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably ear-piercing in-built alarm, so it functions as a home alarm system as well as a security camera.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company.
