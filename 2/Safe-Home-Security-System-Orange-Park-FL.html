<p>We didn't consider alarm that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, usage equipment similar to that of DIY systems, featured long and usually difficult agreements, and often rely on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they use little benefit.

<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a hard disk drive for later retrieval. Displays can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and monthly robbery and fire monitoring. The total installation charge alone was not cheap-- several thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even trigger incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen often enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's initial acclaimed system or their most recent line of equipment. Both systems use outstanding, trustworthy home security.
