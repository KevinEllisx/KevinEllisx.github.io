<p>Installation of the wireless alarm system can be a do-it-yourself" task for those who are handy, however a professional installation is advised if the property owner is not familiar with wireless alarm systems, to guarantee whatever is appropriately established. Expert installation can vary from $350 to $1,200 depending on the coverage desired and system components selected, such as wireless security cameras or security lighting.</p>
