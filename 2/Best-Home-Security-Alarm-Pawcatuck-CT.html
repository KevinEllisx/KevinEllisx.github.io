<p>After checking out the discuss this page I went to Armorax's site to see what they used; they've partnered with another security company and their starter package I believe starts at $0 down. The panel and sensing units are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so altogether a lot. At home consultations are sales opportunities for security companies. These consultations can be extremely useful, but they can also offer you on a bunch of equipment you didn't believe you required (and most likely still don't).</p>

<p>Frontpoint uses five packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan but wound up disappointed with its absence of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notice while on getaway, she had no chance of assessing whether her home had actually been gotten into or if her cat had handled to trip the sensing unit. It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
