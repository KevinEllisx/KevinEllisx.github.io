<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth understanding of all the required systems is essential. There are only 2 choices if there are no as-built files offering functionality and setup information to make this integration work. The first choice, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is reluctant or not available to provide those information) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the very same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When your camera are set up, you can pick whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is activated. However, you might choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the customer. </p>
