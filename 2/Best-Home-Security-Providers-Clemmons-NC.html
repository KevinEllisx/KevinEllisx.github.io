<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
