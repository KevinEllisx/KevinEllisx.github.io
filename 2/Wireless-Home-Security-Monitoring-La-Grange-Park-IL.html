<p>Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera offers you an impressive field of view, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.)

<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more affordable memberships out there at $2.99 a month.
