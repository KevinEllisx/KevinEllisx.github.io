<p>For these different systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is essential. If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and setup details to make this combination work, there are just 2 options. The first choice, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is not available or reluctant to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to change and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
