<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide assailants are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can guarantee - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the restricted benefits that the system may supply in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
