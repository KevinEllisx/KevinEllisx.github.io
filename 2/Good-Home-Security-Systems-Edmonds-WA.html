If you'll be away for a vacation, for example, you can purchase 3 days of pro monitoring.</p>

<p>The second crucial thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly raucous inbuilt alarm, so it functions as a home alarm in addition to a security camera.

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is vital. In reality, we do not advise buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to distinguish between a person and a car, for example, permits you to reduce unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
