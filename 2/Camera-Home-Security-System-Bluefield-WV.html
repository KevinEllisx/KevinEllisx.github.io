We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with 2 Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
