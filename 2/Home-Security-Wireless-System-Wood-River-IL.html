<p>Some house owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll hinder prospective intruders. These indications might be attached to a front door, a prominent window, posted in the front lawn, or at the top of a driveway.

These battery powered styles can last for up to 2 years prior to charging.</p>
<p>Whatever Vivint does, it succeeds. Where other alarm companies use a mishmash of third-party equipment, Vivint designs its own things. Where some options, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have a few of the very best features on the market, consisting of video analytics and 4K image sensing units (as well as more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>

<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types just touch the IP camera world and leave out the old analog cameras, given that everybody favors IP cameras today for their budget-friendly prices, features and easy setup.
