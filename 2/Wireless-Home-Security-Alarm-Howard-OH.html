<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

No-contract systems, which permit you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than devoting to a long-term plan, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract.
