<h2>Video Management Surveillance Video Brea</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or numerous, they work with your home's web network to send out video footage right to your computer system or mobile device. The majority of consumer cameras keep data internally, on a removable microSD card, or from another location on the cloud.</p>
<p>From monitoring doors and windows, to ensuring the pool gate is secure, to getting a message when your safe is accessed, or perhaps protecting the medication in the bathroom cabinet - the sensors are small enough to offer unique protection not provided with hard-wired alarm.

Wired security systems are also susceptible to power blackouts. A lot of will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of a failure, however long term outages will result in the system losing power.

Incorrect home network setups, defects in the devices or password compromise might allow a hacker to burglarize the system and figure out if anyone is home, or even take control. Though keeping the huge quantity of data can be a concern, it's not uncommon for IP CCTV systems to have software that governs how long the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for example.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, says there are "major vulnerabilities" in both conventional DVR-based CCTV systems, along with cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "easily" pirate connections to the device's IP address, putting a great deal of people, their homes and data at risk. </p>
