<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.
