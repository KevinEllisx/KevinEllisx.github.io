<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
