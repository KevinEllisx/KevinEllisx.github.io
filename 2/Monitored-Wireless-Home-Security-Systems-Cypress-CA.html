<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send smart device informs with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
