<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
<p>Video surveillance is arguably the next frontier for this technology - and it's already readily available for enterprise-level video surveillance systems. Incorporating facial acknowledgment technology into security systems optimize benefit and safety. Your video surveillance monitoring group can react better to prohibited, threatening, or suspicious individuals. A robust system can even permit security personnel to piece together the puzzle pieces of a security breach or criminal offense.</p>

Both the original House system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we checked that also works with HomeKit.

With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Package, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any regular monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, costs will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you commit to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus strategy opts for $10 each month and does not need a contract.</p>
