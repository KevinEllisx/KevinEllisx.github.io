<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
