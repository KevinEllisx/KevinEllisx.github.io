<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

But ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer service experience differs commonly depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
