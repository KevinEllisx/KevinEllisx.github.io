<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most extreme frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

<h3>Camera Security System Putnam CT 06260</h3>
<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is necessary. There are just 2 options if there are no as-built files supplying performance and configuration details to make this integration work. The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unavailable or unwilling to supply those details) and record the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
