<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
