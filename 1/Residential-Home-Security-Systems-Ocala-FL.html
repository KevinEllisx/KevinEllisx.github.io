<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
