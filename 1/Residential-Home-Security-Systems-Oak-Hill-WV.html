<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies widely depending upon the dealership you choose. </p>
