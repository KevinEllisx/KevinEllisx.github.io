<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even set off incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the police if they take place regularly enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
