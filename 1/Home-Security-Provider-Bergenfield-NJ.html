<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection devices are created to secure specific, concrete properties, such as fashion jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family treasures. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being disarmed. The sensor will set off an alarm if the item to which the gadget has been connected is moved or disturbed.</p>

Both the initial Abode system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we tested that also deals with HomeKit.
