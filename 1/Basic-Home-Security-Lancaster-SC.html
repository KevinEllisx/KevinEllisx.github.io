<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency since it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
