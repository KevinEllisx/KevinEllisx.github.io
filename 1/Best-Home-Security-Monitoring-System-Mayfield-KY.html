<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the precise same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
