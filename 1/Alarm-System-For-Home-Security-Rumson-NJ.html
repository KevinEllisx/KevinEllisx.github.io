<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT irritates us. We see many growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer service experience differs widely depending on the dealership you choose. </p>
