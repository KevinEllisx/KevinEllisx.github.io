<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and belongings. On the occasion that your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are standing by to respond by immediately contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?
