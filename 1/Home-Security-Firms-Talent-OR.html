This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic option for long range scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>

As well as being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light considering that the glass real estate does not restrain the lens. With some, it's tough to inform at a look where they've been intended, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, no matter their real field of vision. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is an excellent option for a number of different configurations.</p>
