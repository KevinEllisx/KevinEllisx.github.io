<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home intrusion emergency. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm must suffice to scare away burglars for the most part. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera video or a broken window to call for authorities reaction.</p>
