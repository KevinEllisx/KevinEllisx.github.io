<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even trigger false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place regularly enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
