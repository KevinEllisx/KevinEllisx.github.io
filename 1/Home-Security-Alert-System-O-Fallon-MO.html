<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the porch by a certified electrician (who takes place to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a wide range of equipment and home automation items at a sensible price, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
