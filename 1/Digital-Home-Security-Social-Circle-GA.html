The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today.

Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can activate a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera identifies motion or sound.

If you devote to a three-year agreement, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus plan goes for $10 per month and does not require a contract.</p>
