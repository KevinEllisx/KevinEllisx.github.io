<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the 3rd generation of the well known Dropcam-- among the first, and among the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed practically anywhere inside your home. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it communicates with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, in addition to various third-party clever- home gadgets.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was blended. Our tester said the professional offered solid customer support: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after deciding that the motion detector sufficed for the entire front half of my home." Nevertheless, there were some concerns with linking the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
