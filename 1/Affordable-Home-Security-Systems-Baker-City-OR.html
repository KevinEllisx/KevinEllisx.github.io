We first discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
