<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment.

After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
