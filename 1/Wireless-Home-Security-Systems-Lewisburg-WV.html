<h2>Home Security Dos And Don'ts Lewisburg</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly irritating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.
