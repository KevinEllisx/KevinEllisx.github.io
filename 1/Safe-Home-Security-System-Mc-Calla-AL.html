Over my 25 plus year profession in the security industry, I have investigated, offered, set up, and because we have our own main station at American Alarm Systems, viewed alarm signals for more hours than I would like to confess.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
