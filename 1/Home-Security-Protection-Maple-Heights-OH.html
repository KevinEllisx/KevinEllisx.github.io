<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring in Maple Heights OH</h3>

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
