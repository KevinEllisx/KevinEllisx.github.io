Users can set up which locations of their camera are more sensitive to motion. This camera uses a rechargeable battery or solar energy, so you have a great deal of versatility about where to place it. In our experience, the battery drains fairly rapidly if you don't use the solar panel accessory.</p>
<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment prices is very sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
