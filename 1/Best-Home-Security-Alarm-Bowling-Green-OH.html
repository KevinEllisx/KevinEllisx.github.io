<p>Another important topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend just how much is enough.

The exact same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
