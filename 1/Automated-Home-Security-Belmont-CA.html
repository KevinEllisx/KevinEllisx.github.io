<p>Studies reveal surveillance cameras decrease crime. Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording unit, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complex - especially if your home has actually already been constructed - so make certain to talk to a professional prior to handling the job yourself. Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're likewise not vulnerable to interference such as cellular and radio frequencies.
