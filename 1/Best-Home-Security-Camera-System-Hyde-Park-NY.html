<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera in Hyde Park NY</h3>
<p>On the surface, these two camera categories may appear comparable, though if you were able to see within, the distinctions become unique and apparent. Commercial-grade cameras are designed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not.

<h3>Digital Home Security in New York</h3>
<p>Home security systems are readily available in two basic forms: monitored and unmonitored.
