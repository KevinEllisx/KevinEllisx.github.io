<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
