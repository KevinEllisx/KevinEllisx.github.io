Because the Pro 2 doesn't do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to in fact switch on when it detects motion.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
