<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve.

<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart version that sends signals straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a wide variety of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road.
