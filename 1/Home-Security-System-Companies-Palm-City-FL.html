As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.

Regardless of a basic enhancement in wireless innovation, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and disarmed. </p>
