<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring Systems Jerseyville IL 62052</h3>
<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't a choice, you might wish to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are discreet and small, sometimes suited daily objects such as clocks, smoke alarm, and magnets.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
