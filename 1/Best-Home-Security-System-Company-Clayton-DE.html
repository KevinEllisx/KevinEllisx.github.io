<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
