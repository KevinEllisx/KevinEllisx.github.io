<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

It doesn't work with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we do not anticipate it to add extra performance anytime quickly.</p>
