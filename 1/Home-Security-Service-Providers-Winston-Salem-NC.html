We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
