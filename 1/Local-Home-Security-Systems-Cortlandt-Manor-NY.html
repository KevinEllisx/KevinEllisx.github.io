<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
