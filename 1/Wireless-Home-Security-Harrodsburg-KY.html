<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or more in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range problems.</p>
