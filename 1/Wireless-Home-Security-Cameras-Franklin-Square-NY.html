<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is essential. In fact, we don't advise purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and a car, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
