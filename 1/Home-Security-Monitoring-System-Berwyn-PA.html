<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. Standard components in most home security packages include a master control panel, the control keypad, sensing unit pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit gadget. Some systems are connected to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms. Of course you can buy more equipment like surveillance cameras, glass break sensors, CO detectors and smoke detector.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
