We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
