<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
