<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
