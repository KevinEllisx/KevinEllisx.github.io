<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smartphone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
