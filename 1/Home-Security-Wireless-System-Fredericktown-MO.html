<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally don't come with in advance fees. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
