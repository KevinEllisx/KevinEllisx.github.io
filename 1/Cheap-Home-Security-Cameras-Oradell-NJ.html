<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level.
