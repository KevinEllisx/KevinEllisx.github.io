<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
