<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly groundbreaking, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year agreement, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication.
