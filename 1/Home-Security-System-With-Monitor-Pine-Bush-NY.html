<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

Blink Security Cameras are a fine example of a system we are continuously helping clients change. As experts in the market our recommendations is to keep away. Initially examine the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice if you do buy them.</p>
