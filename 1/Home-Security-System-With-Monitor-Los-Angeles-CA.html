It can be awkward and slow to utilize on event - with the procedure of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid sometimes. The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have actually a cable television attached however, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit simpler to mess up for potential trespassers.
