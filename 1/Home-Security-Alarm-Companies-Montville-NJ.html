<p>Contact among our security experts with any questions you might have about home alarm monitoring. While it might come as a surprise, burglar alarms have been around for over 150 years.

The first home alarm was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian innovator named Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. Simply put, NVR records higher-quality video and allows for systems to be scaled up a lot more easily than can be done with DVR.
