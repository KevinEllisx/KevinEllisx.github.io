<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
