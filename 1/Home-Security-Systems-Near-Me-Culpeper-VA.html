<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home invasion emergency situation. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm needs to be enough to frighten intruders in many cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to call for police response.</p>
