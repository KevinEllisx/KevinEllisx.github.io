<h2>Benefits Of Using A CCTV System In 2019 Trinity</h2>

<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
