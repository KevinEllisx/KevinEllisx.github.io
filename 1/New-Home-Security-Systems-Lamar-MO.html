For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage choice conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud. However, this is normally a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
