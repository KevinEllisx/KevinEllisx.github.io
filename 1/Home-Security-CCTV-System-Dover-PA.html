<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup process. This generally involves discovering an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. Many of them then enable you to configure the alert frequency and produce activity monitoring zones, so the camera will catch motion only in designated locations-- a feature we discover required for high-traffic locations, which could trigger a lot of incorrect signals.</p>
