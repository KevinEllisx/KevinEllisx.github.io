<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, since apparently they car restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a problem, way too costly, and not fantastic.</p>
