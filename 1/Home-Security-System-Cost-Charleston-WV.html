You will not get a cash or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise required under suitable law to reimburse the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by suitable law, return a sum equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any quantities due on your account (including, without limitation, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, altered or not returned).</p>
