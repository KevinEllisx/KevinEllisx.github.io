<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be harmful to both people and animals. Since carbon monoxide gas is odor-free and colorless, the only way to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your house increases to an unsafe level. With a wireless system, you can also get push notifications on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is an issue, even when you're not in your home.</p>

<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set amount of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Spending for the equipment up front offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service.
