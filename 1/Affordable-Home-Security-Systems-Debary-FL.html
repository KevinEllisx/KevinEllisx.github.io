<p>Clear night vision is among the most important features for outdoor security cameras. To get the best and brightest night view, think about a camera with infrared (IR) innovation to sending out intense light through wavelengths. The number of infrared LEDs utilized in a camera determines how far your outdoor security camera will have the ability to clearly reveal what's outside your home.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was reasonably amazed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious.
