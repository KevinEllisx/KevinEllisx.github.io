No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in total control of the equipment you use, in addition to how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>

<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies?
