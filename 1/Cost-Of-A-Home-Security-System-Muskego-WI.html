<p>When SCW was established in 2010, we knew we had a job to do. Security cameras were never easy, and it was difficult to understand what you were getting or what to do with it. From the start, it has constantly been our purpose to provide the absolute best item for our customers' needs, however that's inadequate.

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same method as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing enjoying outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the very same individual might position a surveillance camera then from another location view an individual within the privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
