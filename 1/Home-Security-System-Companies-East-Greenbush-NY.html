<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
