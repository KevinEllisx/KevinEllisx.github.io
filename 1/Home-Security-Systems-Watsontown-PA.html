<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If catching footage in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
