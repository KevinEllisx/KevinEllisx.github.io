<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is vital.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to distinguish between an automobile and a person, for instance, allows you to cut down on unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, or even garbage cans. </p>
