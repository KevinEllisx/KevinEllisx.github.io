<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who really is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the exact same person might place a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most significantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>
