<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
