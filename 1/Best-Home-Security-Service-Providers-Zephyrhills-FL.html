<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year agreement, however given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication.
