<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.
