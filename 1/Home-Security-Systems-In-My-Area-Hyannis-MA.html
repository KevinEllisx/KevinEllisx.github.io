<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was fairly amazed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the individual being seen understand they're being viewed, and you can select to tape-record video or photos and save them to your smart gadget on a whim. </p>
