<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety.

<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cell phone - anytime, anywhere.

Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the police if they happen frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
