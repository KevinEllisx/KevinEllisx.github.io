A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not connect. An aid window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was a concern with the circuit board.

Despite that, the alarm ought to be enough to scare away trespassers for the most part.
