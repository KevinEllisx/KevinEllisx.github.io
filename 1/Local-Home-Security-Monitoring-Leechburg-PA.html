<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see many growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer support experience differs extensively depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
