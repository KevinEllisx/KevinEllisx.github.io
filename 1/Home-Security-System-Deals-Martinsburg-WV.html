<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
