<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
