<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
