Possibly more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should instantly understand.</p>
<p>The alarm user has thirty (30) days from the date of notification to submit an appeal. Appeals should remain in composing and accompanied by supporting paperwork. Supporting documentation for appeal could be subsequent police reports, documents of power failures, insurance claims and pictures of actual damage done to residential or commercial property. The Alarm Division supervisor will determine whether to grant the appeal with periodic assessment with the Director.</p>
