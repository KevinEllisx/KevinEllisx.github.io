<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
