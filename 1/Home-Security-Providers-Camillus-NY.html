<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the third generation of the well known Dropcam-- among the very first, and one of the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to establish and, thanks to its magnetic, swiveling base, it can be set up nearly anywhere inside your home. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it interacts with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as various third-party smart- home devices.
