<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
