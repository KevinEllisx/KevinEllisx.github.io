<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
