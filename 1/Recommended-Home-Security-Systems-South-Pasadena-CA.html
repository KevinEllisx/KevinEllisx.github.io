<p>Nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. You do not need to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and possessions. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are waiting to respond by instantly contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>A self-monitored security system is typically created to be simple so you can install it yourself without problem. But it might lack the essential sophistication of a professionally monitored system. The difference between a standard alarm system and a wise one is that various components within the system can interact with one another. Not only does clever innovation offer you the capability to manage and monitor your home alarm system from anywhere-- it also makes your system able to respond to your regimens and habits.</p>

Monitors can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
