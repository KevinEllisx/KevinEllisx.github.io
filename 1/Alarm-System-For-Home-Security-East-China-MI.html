<p>Different kinds of CCTV cameras. Here's another impressive wireless security function-- the Motion Detector. These infrared devices are mounted inside your home. The alarm sounds and you'll get an alert when they detect motion. Rest assured, if there's any motion or turmoil, you'll be the first to know. The very best motion detectors can distinguish between individuals and animals, and some even boast facial recognition innovation.</p>
<p>When motion is spotted, nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensing unit that will activate the camera to tape video. The sensing unit can also start a push alert to your phone when activity is occurring, and some will also create an email alert. For an additional layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you know if someone is out there even if they're out of range of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit.

<p>Customer care is Frontpoint's strength. While the company does not provide quite as lots of hours of consumer support as other brand names, it has a wonderful track record with lots of vocal, happy customers.
