<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
