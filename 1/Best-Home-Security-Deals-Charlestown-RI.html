<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
