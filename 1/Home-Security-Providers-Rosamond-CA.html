<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see specifically when a particular individual arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a clever smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even much better proposition.</p>
<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, however it indicates you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It likewise means that if you really saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might rapidly tape-record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would suffice to send out even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
