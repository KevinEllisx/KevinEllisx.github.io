And because SimpliSafe has no contracts, it doesn't charge fees for canceling your month-to-month plan.</p>

Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as getting in touch with homeowner, notifying cops, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals might be sent via devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>

Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed trip and your spotty cell service suggests you do not get alerted until the next day?
