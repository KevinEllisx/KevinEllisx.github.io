When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.

<p>For these separate systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed knowledge of all the required systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup information to make this integration work, there are just two choices.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
