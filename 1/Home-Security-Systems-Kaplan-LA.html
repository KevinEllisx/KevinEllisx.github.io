<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smartphone notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
