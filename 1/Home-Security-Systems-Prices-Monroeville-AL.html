<p>I described that all we would need to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once clients understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
