When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, once again based upon whether the style is generally open or generally closed.

<p>If you currently own a Ring video doorbell and want to expand your home security protection, adding Ring Alarm makes good sense.

Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all offer an outstanding customer experience and user-friendly, innovative security tech.
