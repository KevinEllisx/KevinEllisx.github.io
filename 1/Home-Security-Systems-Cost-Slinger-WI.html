<p>A wise lock is usually part of a robust clever home security setup, but you don't have to buy a full-blown system to use one. If you're utilizing a home automation center to manage things like lighting and thermostats, you can add a Z-Wave or Zigbee smart lock to the system without much effort. At the same time, if you don't have a home automation center, search for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize standard pre-drilled holes and are fairly easy to install. Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others require that you eliminate your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
