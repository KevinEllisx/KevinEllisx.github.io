<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company.

However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the client service experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you go with. </p>
