<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face recognition.

After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
