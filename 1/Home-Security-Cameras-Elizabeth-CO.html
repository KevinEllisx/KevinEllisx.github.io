<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even trigger false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most affordable monitoring strategy beginning at $10.
