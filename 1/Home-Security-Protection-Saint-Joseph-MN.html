Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to compare an individual and a vehicle, for instance, permits you to cut down on unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
