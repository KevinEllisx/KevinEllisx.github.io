<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the client service experience differs commonly depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
