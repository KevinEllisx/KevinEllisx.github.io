<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically much safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just wouldn't link.

<h3>House Burglar Alarm Systems in Waterford CT</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
