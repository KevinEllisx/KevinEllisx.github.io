<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
