<p>Multiple monitors were installed within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm display screens. Once any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the closest camera to that location would be displayed on that particular monitor.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
