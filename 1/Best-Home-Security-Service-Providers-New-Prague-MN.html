<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
