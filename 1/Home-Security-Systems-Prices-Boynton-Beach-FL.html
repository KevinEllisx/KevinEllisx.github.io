<p>Blue cameras are compatible with Alexa and IFTTT just. Apple HomeKit compatibility coming soon to all Blue cameras. For too long, the wise home hasn't been very clever. It's made complex to set up and manage, with a lot of different gadgets that don't work well together. So we're simplifying things and uniting all Nest and Google Home products under one roof. Introducing Google Nest. Welcome to the helpful home.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration).
