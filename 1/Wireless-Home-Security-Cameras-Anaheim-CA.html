<p>The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many link to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, placement is more versatile.

If somebody were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
