We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is incredibly sensible, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
