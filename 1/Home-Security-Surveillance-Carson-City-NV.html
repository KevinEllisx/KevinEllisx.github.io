<p>When set off, alarm systems most commonly do 7 main tasks. The first task is the alert of a siren, this enables everybody in your neighborhood including the property owners or entrepreneur to understand that an intruder has been detected. The 2nd task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all alarm systems have flashing outdoor lights however the most typical alarm system and a few of the advanced ones do. The most typical sort of burglar alarms possess an automobile dialer which alerts cops in the location to dispatch to the business or the home that is being burglarized.
