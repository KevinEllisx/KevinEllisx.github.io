<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.
