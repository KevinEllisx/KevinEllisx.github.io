We believe that's pricey.</p>

<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you've labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is vital. In fact, we don't suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an individual and an automobile, for instance, enables you to cut down on unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
