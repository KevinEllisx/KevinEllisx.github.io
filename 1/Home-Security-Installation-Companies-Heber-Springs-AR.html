<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom.

And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
